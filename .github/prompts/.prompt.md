# üê¶ Bird Checklist Prompt

You are building a **bird checklist** web app using [Astro](https://astro.build), Preact, Bulma CSS, and persistent storage with [Deno KV](https://deno.com/kv). The app should be lightweight, static, and ready for deployment on [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy).

## Requirements

- **Bird List:** Display a list of birds with an action to ‚ÄúMark as Seen.‚Äù
- **Filter:** Allow users to filter and show only birds they‚Äôve spotted.
- **UI:** Use Bulma for a modern, responsive interface.
- **Framework:** Use Astro for static site generation and Preact for interactivity.
- **Persistence:** Store user data (bird sightings) using Deno KV for persistence across sessions (especially on Deno Deploy).

## Getting Started

- Local development should work with a mock Deno KV.
- Provide clear instructions for running locally (`npm install` and `npm run dev`), and note that full persistence is available on Deno Deploy.

## Features

- List of birds with ‚ÄúMark as Seen‚Äù action.
- Filter for seen birds.
- Responsive UI with Bulma.
- Astro + Preact for static and interactive features.
- Persistent storage via Deno KV.

## Roadmap

- Add user authentication (cookies or OAuth).
- Integrate a bird data API for richer info and images.
- Add PWA/mobile support.
- Support internationalization.
- Allow export/import of sightings.

## Deployment

- Instructions for deploying to Deno Deploy: sign up, push to GitHub, import as a new project.
